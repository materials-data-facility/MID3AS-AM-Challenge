## Getting Started

* **STEP 1**: **[Create a free Globus account]( https://globus.org/signup )** using institutional credentials, Google ID or ORCID. Globus is required to access the datasets.

* **STEP 2**: **[Join this Globus Group]( https://www.globus.org/app/groups/fe6bbb86-74fe-11e8-b558-0a7d99bc78fe/about )** to gain access to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Additive Manufacturing (AM) Modeling Challenge Series data packages. Joining the group does not obligate you to participate in the challenge, but is required to obtain the data packages.

* **STEP 3**: **[Subscribe Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScibM5JVow6aEfebX5xGLK5zwKRP0O07RdD8jF2Emz6MIcbIQ/viewform?usp=sf_link )** to receive email updates about the AFRL AM Modeling Challenge Series – including information on dataset availability.  (Contact information collected here will only be used to send pertinent updates for the challenges.)

## Eligibility

Challenge problems are open to academia, small and large businesses, national laboratories, both in the U.S. and internationally.  Data packages will be publicly released by AFRL and made available to participants.  Contact information will be required for accessing data packages to allow for challenge updates to be communicated, but does not obligate participation.  Submissions will be kept private during grading, but will be shared anonymously as an aggregate after grading.  Only AFRL will know the identity associated with each submission at any time.  An exception is if a participant is selected as a Top Performer in one of the challenges, then that participant must agree to openly associate their identity with the submission.  Participants will be informed of their submission’s grade/quality and can see other submissions in an anonymous form in a debrief document/journal article.  Participants interested in having their submission graded, but not considered for an award, may discuss with AFRL regarding inclusion in the anonymous aggregate.  Any questions regarding eligibility to participate or accept awards can be addressed to AFRL through the challenge participation site. 

Participants may submit multiple times, but must detail the differences in their modeling approach in the form of a brief abstract, as detailed in the grading section below.  Participants should limit themselves to a reasonable number of submissions (< 10) and are subject to AFRL discretion on how many will be reviewed if more are submitted.

## Awards

Challenge problems will have an associated monetary and/or resource award to be issued to Top Performers.  Exact details of the breakdown of prize money/resources is under development and award amounts will be communicated through the challenge participation site and may be determined by number of participants.  Likely, winners and runners-up of each challenge will be awarded prizes.  An independent third-party will coordinate awards with selected Top Performers.

## Grading

Challenges will be graded by awarding points for each requested prediction, based on accuracy.  For each requested prediction, levels generally deemed "Excellent" > "Good" > "Acceptable" have been established and points will be awarded in increasing value for obtaining each level.  Each challenge problem consists of numerous (> 10) requested predictions.  It is not required that any given submission make all requested predictions, but no points will be earned for unmade predictions.  Each submission should have a brief abstract accompanying the provided answer template detailing the general modeling methodology used to make the predictions.  Lack of an abstract and refusal to provide one may result in decremented points. 

## Schedule

Updates on schedule for each challenge will be posted here as they develop.  The planned submission deadlines for individual challenges are stated in the Challenge Data section above.  Modifications to those dates will be posted here and communicated to all registered participants via email.  AFRL will grade submissions and announce Top Performers approximately four (4) months after the submission deadline.  A workshop will be hosted to debrief participants on the results and honor Top Performers tentatively planned for the week of 24 June 2019.

## Logistics 

Data packages will carry unlimited data rights to the participants with proper citation.  Submissions will be the property of the corresponding participant and not circulated by AFRL.  AFRL is requesting rights to use the submissions in derivative work, but will not distribute any portions of the submissions directly without approval of the corresponding participants.  Participants will be asked to submit results and relevant details of their simulation procedure using a template provided with the challenge problem data package.  The simulation details will be treated with the same rights and procedures as the results themselves.  It should be noted that AFRL is not setting any constraints on the modeling approaches allowed by participants.  Further, any additional information available in literature can be utilized by participants, but should be reported with the submission.
